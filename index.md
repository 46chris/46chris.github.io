*Preview of find method: *  
```
//Find with path compression recursively 
string find(string node){ 
    if(upArr[node] == node){ 
        return node; 
    }
    //Recursion 
    string sentinel = find(upArr[node]); 

    //Recursively path compress 
    upArr[node] = sentinel; 

    return sentinel;
}
```
